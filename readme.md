# LEARNICA Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of LEARNICA â€“ an online learning platform similar to Udemy. This repository contains the backend codebase that powers the LEARNICA application. The backend is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.

## Project Description

LEARNICA is an educational platform designed to facilitate online learning. The platform offers a wide range of courses on various subjects, allowing students to learn at their own pace. Instructors can create and manage courses, while students can enroll in courses, access course materials, and track their progress.

This repository specifically focuses on the backend implementation of LEARNICA. It handles data storage, user authentication, and provides API endpoints for communication with the frontend.

## Backend Deployment

The backend of LEARNICA is deployed using Railway and is accessible at the following link:
